## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a Django Rest Framework project. It is a template for building REST APIs with Django Rest Framework. It is built with the following features;

- User Authentication with JWT
- User Registration
- User Login
- User Logout
- User Password Reset
- User Password Change
- User Profile Update
- Users List API
- Users Detail API
- API Keys Integration: Using Secret keys and Public keys
- Admin and API key DRF Permissions

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For installing the project, you will need to have;

- Python installed. Python version supported is `3.9`. The Github actions use 3.9 for running live tests.

- If Must have PostgreSQL installed. You can use WSL2 to do this on Windows 10 and 11.

> Use postgresql only if you are using it as your default database. If you are using sqlite, you can skip this step.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Clone the project

Setup virtual enviroment & install dependencies

Linux

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
mkdir logs
```

Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
mkdir logs
```

Copy the env.example file to .env

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Run migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Run the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Run tests to make sure all is working before you start contributing

```bash
pytest --no-cov
```

### And coding style tests

This must be used to ensure all coding style guidelines are met

```bash
flake8
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To run the API on your local system.

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

API server will run on `http://localhost:8000/`. Visit [Swagger](http://localhost:8000/admin/api/docs/) to read the Swagger API documentation.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

The following method describes how to deploy this on a live system.

### Using Ngrok

- Install [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started) on your machine.
- Run API server
- Open CMD / CLI, Run `ngrok http 8000`. `8000` is used if that's the port the API server is listening to. Otherwise, use the listening port.
- The rest is history!

### Using Nginx on an Ubuntu Server

#### Coming soon
<!-- A deploy script.sh should be created to automate the deployment on a new server -->
